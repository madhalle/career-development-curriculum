### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
	-sequestered in basement/bedroom
	-snack breaks
* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could interfere with your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those issues? (Examples: my kids, my dog, my partner, etc.) 
	-fam/dogs emergencies go do your thing
* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.
	-hotspot, 
	-siphon neighbors wifi
	-incase of extremes try to commicate if possible
* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
	-50 min on 10 off, try to stick to it unless we're in the flow of writing something that can get finished relatively 		quickly.
* Quarantine is tough, so it‚Äôs important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other‚Äôs well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?
	-check in at the beginning of paired sessions
	-be open if you need personal time in space of planned pairing time
